# First_flask_api

Basic flask API using dictionaries and an sql data base.
Allows user to search for books using id, date published, and author name

# How to execute

If flask is not installed open command line and run "pip install flask"

If you require a virtual env to run flask follow these steps after cloning the repo:
- Open folder with cloned repo
- Open command prompt here
- Run command "virtualenv flask"
- "cd flask"
- "source Scripts/activate"

Once set up is complete follow these steps to run/test the API:
- Clone the github to a repository of your choosing.
- Open the folder in command line
- Run the command "python api.py"

The API should now be running on localhost:5000. You can use postman or web queries to test it.
